## How It Works

### **app.js**
The app.js file acts as the root starting point for the app, as well as the logic behind the pages interactions. At the top of the file (lines 1-17) are all of the setup commands for the server, package setups, and declarations. Below this are the app's get, post, and API request functions. These functions tell the app what actions were preformed by the user, as well as what to do next.

### **signup.html**
This is the main view of the website upon load-up. This page contains all of the Bootstrap forms the user interacts with, as well as some In-line CSS styling.

### **success.html**
This page is where the user gets sent once they completed the signup process after their information is successfully sent to the MailChimp API.

### **failure.html**
This is the fallback page the user is sent to if an error occurred in their provided data, or within the API request process.

### **.env file**
The `.env` file will contain your sensitive information, thus it is not included in this repositories starting files. Upon cloning the repository, you'll need to create your own `.env` file and enter in your personal API key and endpoint. (explained [above](#setup-your-mailchimp-api)).
